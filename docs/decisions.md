# XenosNative — decision log

One entry per decision: date, what was decided, why, and what would make us revisit it. Add entries at the
end, and do not rewrite old ones. If a decision changes, add a new entry that supersedes the old one.

---

## D1 — Replace the D3D layer, not the GPU (2026-10-13)

**Decision:** XenosNative hooks the game's XDK Direct3D library and draws on the host. It does not change
the SDK's Xenos emulation.

**Why:** the remaining GPU cost of POTCAWE on the Xenos path is largely emulation:
- EDRAM ownership transfers;
- resolves through the EDRAM buffer and guest memory;
- texture reloads of resolve results;
- the scene drawn twice because of predicated tiling.

SDK patches 0017–0019 showed how far optimizing the emulator goes: 0019 (lazy resolves) measured no gain.
A renderer that sees D3D calls has none of these costs.

**Revisit if:** Phase 1 shows that the engine bypasses the D3D library for a large part of its rendering.

## D2 — DiligentCore with its Vulkan backend (2026-10-13, Gustavo)

**Decision:** the host API layer is DiligentCore (Apache 2.0), Vulkan backend.

**Why:**
- Hell's Gate proved the combination with the same SDK version (v0.10.0) and the SDK's SPIR-V translator.
- Less of our own code for devices, swap chains, pipelines and resource binding than raw Vulkan.
- A D3D12 backend remains possible later.

**Cost accepted:** a large dependency, and its build integration (known issues, see the plan, Phase 2
step 1).

**Revisit if:** the integration costs more than writing the needed Vulkan code directly on the SDK's
Vulkan device.

## D3 — One repository, the library in its own folder (2026-10-13, Gustavo)

**Decision:** `POTCAWERecompVulkan` is a clone of POTCAWERecomp. XenosNative lives in `xenos_native/`, with
its own CMake target and documents, and with no game-specific code. Once a second game uses it, it is
extracted with `git subtree split --prefix=xenos_native` and used as a submodule.

**Why:** developing a library with one user in two repositories doubles every change. Keeping the folder
clean keeps the extraction a mechanical step.

## D4 — Reuse the SDK's translator and texture code (2026-10-13)

**Decision:** shaders are translated with the SDK's `SpirvShaderTranslator`, and textures are loaded with
the SDK's texture loaders. XenosNative does not write its own.

**Why:** they are proven on these games, through the SDK's Vulkan backend and through Hell's Gate.

**Revisit if:** the translator's `loop { switch }` control flow corrupts shaders on Vulkan (see the plan's
risks). The fix would then be an option in the translator, not a new translator.

## D5 — Keep the Xenos path as fallback and reference; sync-only command processor (2026-10-13)

**Decision:** the original D3D bodies keep running, and the SDK command processor keeps executing the ring
in a sync-only mode. A cvar selects the renderer at startup.

**Why:**
- Synchronization stays correct without reimplementing it: fences, swap and vblank callbacks, waits,
  queries.
- Every comparison has a reference.
- Users keep a working game while parity is incomplete.

**Revisit if:** frame pacing above 60 FPS needs the ring removed (as Hell's Gate found).

## D6 — Starting point: POTCAWERecomp `rt-to-texture` at `c6be8a3` (2026-10-13)

**Decision:** the clone starts from `rt-to-texture`, not `main`.

**Why:** SDK patch 0020 (occlusion queries, the sun flare) exists only there, and it is applied on top of
patch 0019. Patch 0019 (lazy resolves) is an option that is off and harmless.

## D7 — Hell's Gate as a design reference only (2026-10-13)

**Decision:** no code is copied from Hell's Gate. Its documents inform the design, and it is credited.

**Why:** its repository has no license (checked 2026-10-13 through the GitHub API: `license: null`), which
means all rights are reserved. Its documents are kept for personal reference in `local_docs/reference/`,
which is gitignored.

**Revisit if:** the author adds a license or gives permission. Then record which code was adopted, under
which terms.

## D8 — Name: XenosNative (2026-10-13, Gustavo)

**Decision:** folder `xenos_native/`, namespace `xenos_native`, CMake target `xenos_native`, cvars prefixed
`xenos_native`.

## D9 — The game files are copied (2026-10-13, Gustavo)

**Decision:** `assets/` holds a full copy of the game files (6.4 GB), so the project does not depend on
POTCAWERecomp's folder.

## D10 — XenosNative's SDK patches travel with the library (2026-10-13, proposed)

**Decision (to confirm with the first such patch):**
- SDK changes that only XenosNative needs go into `xenos_native/sdk_patches/` and are applied after the
  shared series. Examples: the sync-only command processor mode, the draw callback for the observer, and
  exports of translator and texture code if that route is chosen.
- `cmake/apply_sdk_patches.cmake` applies both folders.
- The shared `patches/` series stays identical to GRAWRecomp's and KameoRecomp's.

**Why:** when `xenos_native/` is extracted, its SDK requirements go with it. Games that do not use
XenosNative do not carry its patches.

**Note:** the observer and the trace mode are part of the library, not debug instrumentation. Every new
game goes through them, so project rule 2 (no debug instrumentation in the repository) does not apply to
them. They are off by default and cost nothing when off.

## D11 — D10 confirmed: the draw observer is XenosNative's first SDK patch (2026-10-13)

**Decision:**
- D10 holds. `xenos_native/sdk_patches/0001` adds `IGraphicsSystem::SetDrawObserver`: an optional
  callback the command processor calls for every draw packet it executes.
- `cmake/apply_sdk_patches.cmake` applies `xenos_native/sdk_patches/` after `patches/`, in one series: one
  stamp, and the same "start over" message if anything changed.
- The patch bumps `kGpuPluginAbiVersion` to 2, because the plugin interface gained a virtual function.

**Why:**
- The observer needs the command processor's register file at each draw, and the command processor lives
  in the GPU plugin DLL.
- A plain C callback with a plain-data structure crosses the DLL boundary safely.
- With no observer set, the patch costs one relaxed atomic load per type-3 packet.
- The shared series stays identical to GRAWRecomp's and KameoRecomp's.

**Revisit if:** the SDK gains its own draw hook upstream; then drop the patch.

## D12 — A draw's state: the device shadow, plus the packets the draw call itself wrote (2026-10-13)

**Decision:** XenosNative rebuilds a draw's GPU state from the device structure (register shadow,
constants, fetch constants, current objects) **and** from the packets the D3D call wrote. It reads those
packets right after the call returns, to get what the library writes only into the command buffer:
- the program control registers;
- the shader microcode actually loaded (`IM_LOAD`);
- the shaders' literal constants (`LOAD_ALU_CONSTANT`), kept in a small persistent model;
- `VGT_INDX_OFFSET`;
- fetch constants written outside the flush.

The rules are in [`xdk-d3d-reference.md`](xdk-d3d-reference.md#rebuilding-a-draws-gpu-state).

**Why:**
- The shadow alone matched 92 % of POTCAWE's draws in the observer. The shadow plus the call's own packets
  match 100 % in every verified scene.
- The alternative for the program registers and the literals was to reimplement the XDK's program flush
  from the shader objects. That is more code, more version-specific, and needs its own verification.
- Hell's Gate reached the same conclusion for the vertex shader variant: it reads the last `IM_LOAD`.
- The packet reader is small and follows only register writes, constant and shader loads, and indirect
  buffers. It is not a second command processor: no draws, predication, events or EDRAM.

**Revisit if:** a game writes the same state through a path the reader does not follow (for example an
engine constant buffer outside the call's range). The observer would show it as a mismatch.

## D13 — Bring-up features share one hook per entry point (2026-10-13)

**Decision:**
- The game declares each entry point once (`XENOS_NATIVE_HOOK(address, Call)`, in its own executable).
- The library dispatches every hooked call to its features (trace, observer, later the renderer) with
  whether it is nested in another hooked call, and ends the frame at Present.
- The list of calls is one table (`include/xenos_native/calls.inc`): name, argument names for the trace,
  flags.
- Features are off by default:
  - cvars `xenos_native_trace` and `xenos_native_verify`;
  - keys F9 and F10, through the SDK's rebindable keybinds.

  With all features off a hook is one branch around the original.

**Why:**
- A new game writes one line per function and gets the trace and the observer for free.
- The nesting flag tells the engine's calls from the library's internal ones (Clear → ClearF,
  DrawVerticesUP → BeginVertices, EndTiling → SetPredication).
- The renderer of Phase 2 will plug into the same dispatch.

## D14 — Go for Phase 2 (2026-10-13, Gustavo)

**Decision:** Phase 1 met its exit criterion, so XenosNative goes on to the core renderer (Phase 2).

**Why:** every draw of POTCAWE is visible at the D3D layer, and its GPU state is rebuilt exactly (100 % in
every verified scene). The costs D1 targets are all there and reachable:
- the aliased clears are library calls;
- the tiled scene is issued once by the CPU;
- the resolves are explicit calls with a destination texture.

**Also decided:** the analysis tools of Phase 1 move into the library (`xenos_native/tools/`), generic and
tracked, so the next game uses them as they are.

## D15 — The SDK's graphics code compiled into XenosNative, the cvars left to the plugin (2026-10-13)

**Decision (Phase 2, step 2):**
- XenosNative compiles the part of the SDK's graphics code it needs into its own static target
  `xenos_native_sdk`:
  - the SPIR-V shader translator and `SpirvShader`;
  - the register file;
  - the ucode, texture and draw utilities.
- The GPU plugin keeps its own copy, as it is.
- The cvars stay the plugin's: three cvars the code reads get accessors that forward to the plugin's
  registered value (`src/sdk_cvars.cpp`), and `util/draw.cpp`, which defines two cvars, is compiled
  through a wrapper (`src/sdk_draw.cpp`) that turns those definitions into forwarders.
- `util/draw_extent_estimator.cpp` (it defines `execute_unclipped_draw_vs_on_cpu`) and `flags.cpp` are
  not compiled.

**Why:**
- The plugin is a DLL with hidden symbols; exporting C++ classes from it would need a large SDK patch.
  Hell's Gate also compiles the SDK sources into its executable.
- The cvar registry ignores a second registration of a name. The executable's static initializers run
  before the plugin is loaded, so a second copy of the definitions would win, and the settings
  (`potcawe.toml`, the command line, `src/startup.cpp`'s defaults such as
  `execute_unclipped_draw_vs_on_cpu = true`) would stop reaching the plugin, which still runs the Xenos
  path. Forwarders keep one registration, the plugin's.

**Revisit if:** the SDK exports a shader translation interface from the plugin, or moves the cvar
definitions out of the sources XenosNative needs.

## D16 — XenosNative's utility shaders: GLSL, compiled at startup with the SDK's glslang (2026-10-13)

**Decision:**
- XenosNative's own shaders are written in GLSL: the copies of resolves, presenting, later clears of
  rectangles.
- They are compiled to SPIR-V when the renderer starts, with the glslang library the SDK already builds
  (`src/glsl.cpp`, with glslang's default resource limits).
- DiligentCore receives SPIR-V only, as for the game's shaders.

**Why:**
- DiligentCore is built without its compilers (`DILIGENT_NO_GLSLANG`, D15). Turning them on would bring
  a second glslang and SPIRV-Tools next to the SDK's.
- Writing the utility shaders with the SPIR-V builder, as the SDK does for its own, is much more code
  for a handful of small shaders.
- Precompiled SPIR-V would need a build step and a glslang executable the SDK does not build.

**Cost:** a few milliseconds at startup.

## D17 — Guest memory and primitives: the SDK's SharedMemory and PrimitiveProcessor on DiligentCore (2026-10-13)

**Decision:**
- Vertex and index data reach the GPU the way the SDK's backends do it: one 512 MB storage buffer mirrors
  guest physical memory, the translated vertex shaders fetch vertices from it, and indexed draws use it
  as their index buffer.
- XenosNative does not reimplement this. It subclasses the SDK's `SharedMemory` (`src/guest_memory.cpp`)
  and `PrimitiveProcessor` (`src/primitives.cpp`), which are backend-independent, and gives them
  DiligentCore buffers. Both base classes are compiled into `xenos_native_sdk` (D15).
- Each draw requests the ranges its vertex fetch constants and its index buffer cover. Pages already
  valid cost nothing. A page is uploaded again after the CPU writes it, which the base class learns
  through the memory's write watches.

**Why:**
- The page watches cover every CPU write, with or without Unlock. The planned alternative, hooking the
  Unlock cache flush, misses the Bink planes (written without Unlock) and the dynamic data written into
  the command buffer.
- The primitive processor already knows every conversion the host needs: triangle fans, quad lists and
  line loops to lists and strips, points and rectangles expanded in the vertex shader, primitive reset
  values. Index endianness is swapped by the vertex shader, so guest index buffers are used in place.
- The SDK's own `SharedMemory` stays idle on this path (host rendering is off, D5). The memory's
  invalidation callbacks support several listeners, so the two coexist.

**Cost:** about 170 small copies per frame at the dock (1.5 MB, mostly vertex data the game writes every
frame). Each copy ends the render pass in progress. To revisit in Phase 3.

**Rejected:** the Unlock hook as the only invalidation source (incomplete, above). It stays a possible
optimization: it names exact ranges where page watches need an access violation.

## D18 — Resources bound by name through DiligentCore's SPIR-V reflection (2026-10-13)

**Decision:**
- The translator's SPIR-V is given to DiligentCore unchanged except for one instruction (below).
  DiligentCore reflects it and remaps its descriptor sets to its own layout.
- XenosNative binds by the names DiligentCore reports:
  - storage and uniform buffers by their block type: `XeSharedMemory`, `XeSystemConstants`,
    `XeFloatConstants`, `XeBoolLoopConstants`, `XeFetchConstants`;
  - textures and samplers by their variable names, `xe_texture{N}_{2d|3d|cube}_{u|s}` and
    `xe_sampler{N}_...`, in the order of the shader's bindings.
- The buffers are static variables, one per stage; textures and samplers are dynamic variables, set per
  draw.
- The translator's `Features` describe the DiligentCore device: SPIR-V 1.5, one shared memory binding,
  full 32-bit indices, no clip or cull distances, swizzles applied in the shader.
- `OpSource Unknown 0` is added to every module.

**Why:**
- DiligentCore names a buffer by its block type unless the module says it is HLSL.
- `XeFloatConstants` exists in both stages with different contents, so it must not become one resource.
- DiligentCore refuses a module without `OpSource`, and glslang's builder writes none for an unknown
  source language.
- DiligentCore does not enable shader clip and cull distances. Image views with a swizzle would need one
  view per swizzle.

**Rejected:** declaring an explicit pipeline resource signature with the translator's set and binding
numbers. It is more code, and DiligentCore would remap the bindings anyway.

## D19 — Viewport: the translated shaders produce Direct3D-style Y (2026-10-13)

**Decision:** draws use `draw_util::GetHostViewportInfo` with `origin_bottom_left = true`, as the SDK's
D3D12 backend does, and pass the viewport to DiligentCore unchanged.

**Why:** DiligentCore's Vulkan backend flips Y with a negative viewport height, to behave like Direct3D.
The SDK's Vulkan backend expects an unflipped viewport. With the flag, the two flips cancel, and the pixels
(and so the winding rule) are those of the SDK's Vulkan path.

## D20 — D12 completed: the draw packet's registers, and microcode copied when loaded (2026-10-13)

**Decision:** two additions to the rebuild of D12, found when draws first ran:
- `VGT_DRAW_INITIATOR`, `VGT_DMA_BASE` and `VGT_DMA_SIZE` come from the draw packet itself, which the
  command processor decodes into those registers. The tracker reads every draw packet, including
  bin-predicated ones: the XDK predicates all draw packets, tiled or not.
- The tracker copies the vertex and pixel microcode when the call that loads it (`IM_LOAD`) returns, and
  keeps the copy.

**Why:**
- The observer compared the register shadow's groups only. These three registers are outside them, so
  Phase 1's 100 % did not cover them. Without them, every draw used the initiator of the last internal
  rectangle (a clear or a resolve).
- The GPU copies the microcode when it executes the `IM_LOAD`; later draws run the copy. While a level
  loads, the game frees and reuses that memory: reading it at draw time gave microcode the SDK's
  disassembler threw on, and the game crashed while the dock loaded. With the copy, no shader has failed
  analysis since.

## D21 — Packets read when each command buffer segment ends; D20's explanation corrected (2026-10-13)

**Decision:**
- The tracker reads a call's packets as soon as each command buffer segment ends (the nested
  `KickSegment`), and the rest when the call returns. Before, it read everything when the call returned.
- Shader microcode (`IM_LOAD`, `IM_LOAD_IMMEDIATE`) and `LOAD_ALU_CONSTANT` data are copied at the moment
  the packet is read.
- The shader cache protects the SDK's analysis against access violations as well as exceptions (some
  invalid microcode makes it dereference null), and logs where a rejected program came from.

**Why:** D20 said the vertex shader memory was reused while a level loads. The diagnostics showed
something more specific:
- the failing programs are vertex shaders loaded inline (`IM_LOAD_IMMEDIATE`, 105–192 dwords) by
  `DrawIndexedVertices`;
- our copy matches the shader the SDK dumps (`--dump_shaders`) for its first 16–22 dwords, then holds a
  coherency packet sequence (`COHER_STATUS_HOST`, `COHER_SIZE_HOST`, `COHER_BASE_HOST`, `WAIT_REG_MEM`, as
  `sub_822B0010` writes it) where the microcode should be.

Reading each finished segment early removed most of these, but not all: one load in three still shows a
few (3 in `potcawe_046`). Something writes that sequence into the command buffer over the inline
microcode. The Xenos path, which reads the microcode later (when the command processor executes the
packet), has never failed on these shaders, so the final contents are probably right, but that is not
verified packet by packet. The writer is not identified yet (open point in `local_docs/05-phase2.md`). Meanwhile the draws that get such a program are skipped and logged,
not crashed on.

## D22 — DiligentCore patched for robust buffer access; frames in flight bounded (2026-10-14)

**Decision:**
- XenosNative's changes to DiligentCore are a `git format-patch` series in `xenos_native/diligent_patches/`,
  applied to the submodule at configure time (`xenos_native/cmake/apply_diligent_patches.cmake`), as the
  SDK's patches are (D10). It is made on the submodule's branch `xenos-native`, in a worktree.
- Patch 0001 enables Vulkan's `robustBufferAccess` when the device supports it.
- `Device::Present` waits for the GPU to finish the frame two frames back (a DiligentCore fence).
- The renderer logs an error when DiligentCore's command queue fence falls more than 64 submissions behind
  while frames complete.

**Why:**
- Without the feature the device was lost (`VK_ERROR_DEVICE_LOST`) on the first frames of the Port Royal
  dock; with it, it is not. So some buffer access goes out of range. Which one is not identified: the
  translated shaders read guest memory (vertices, indices) at addresses taken from the game's fetch
  constants, and the bound views and buffers have fixed sizes. The SDK's Vulkan backend enables
  `robustBufferAccess` too; DiligentCore does not, and has no option for it.
- DiligentCore ignores Vulkan errors in release builds. After the loss, its waits returned at once and the
  game kept running at 60 FPS, but its command queue fence stopped advancing (it reads fence status, which
  reported the loss), so its dynamic heap was only reclaimed when it filled up and DiligentCore forced a
  GPU idle (every 1.4 s), the duration queries never completed, and the GPU sat at 8.6 %. That looked like
  a GPU that could not keep up; it was a lost device. The check above makes the next one visible.
- Without vertical sync DiligentCore's swap chain uses mailbox presentation, which never blocks: nothing
  bounded how far the CPU could run ahead of a slow GPU.

**Evidence:** `local_docs/05-phase2.md`, runs 20–26: `vkGetFenceStatus` returned -4 from the first dock
frames on; with the feature enabled, no loss, no heap exhaustion, the queue fence 3 submissions behind, GPU
utilization 69 % for 10.7 ms of GPU time per frame.

**Rejected:** creating the Vulkan device in XenosNative and attaching DiligentCore to it
(`AttachToVulkanDevice`): more code to keep in step with DiligentCore's own device setup, for one feature.
